# Make use of the ecklonia.csv dataset:
# Explore the data (Hint* head, tail, glimpse functions)
# Demonstrate the dimensions of the dataset
# Create three graphs; bargraph, line graph and boxplot: Write hypothesis for each of the graphs and answer these hypotheses
# Make use of the ggarrange function and arrange these three graphs created above into 1 plot
# All graphs must have labels as well as titles
# Calculate the mean,max,min,median and variance for the stipe_length, stipe_diameter for each of the sites (Hint* group_by site)
# Calculate standard error- DAY 1
# Determine the min and maximum frond length and stipe length
# Determine the overall summary of the dataset
